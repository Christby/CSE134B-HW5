        <h2>Technical Skills:</h2>
        <div class="tech_skill">
            <p class="skill"><b>Java</b>: I have over 6 years of software development experience 
                in Java, creating games, plugins, and various other applications, 
                including a client request library, content-aware image resizer, 
                audio analyzer, compiler/transpiler, an early version of my OpenGL 
                game engine which I later ported to C++, and many more.
            </p>
            <p class="skill"><b>C++</b>: I have over 4 years of experience programming in C++. 
                My C++ projects include a custom game engine using the OpenGL 
                graphics library, and many other projects relating to machine learning 
                and computer vision using the OpenCV computer vision library, 
                such as my collage generator, ray casting simulation, object tracker.
            </p>
            <p class="skill"><b>Python</b>: Over the past 3 years, I've had extensive experience with Python 
                in the course of my research, classwork, and personal projects. 
                Some of my personal projects in Python include my Monte Carlo 
                Localization library, smartwatch-controlled presentation tool, financial 
                graph tool, neural model library, NN trainer library, and many more.
            </p>
            <p class="skill"><b>Computer vision</b>: I have significant research experience in the field of 
                computer vision, including Computer Vision Tools for Locating 
                Nitrogren-Vacancy Centers. I've also created dozens of programs using 
                libraries such as OpenCV and OpenGL â€“ these include my object tracker, 
                collage generator, game engine, ray casting simulation, and many more.

        <h2>Teamwork Skills:</h2>
        <div class="team_skill">
            <p class="skill"><b>Cooperative Attitude</b>: Working in a team can be challenging at times, 
                but more often it is a great opportunity to uncover creative ideas, share 
                different perspectives and experiences, as well as enhance my own skills. 
                I treat every group project as a learning experience and I always help foster 
                a more productive team environment. 
            </p>
            <p class="skill"><b>Problem Solving</b>: I am able to think outside the box when challenges or 
                issues arise. Rather than focusing on negative outcomes, I can stay calm 
                and help the team work towards a solution. This helps me uncover roadblocks 
                or inefficiencies that are inhibiting the team's success.
            </p>
            <p class="skill"><b>Critical Thinking</b>: Critical thinking allows me to make better decisions. 
                It can be tempting to follow along with whatever the group decides, or what 
                one team member believes is the best action, but sometimes a different approach 
                or a new idea can help achieve better results. By thinking critically about the 
                situation: examining all sides of an issue, reflecting on past experiences, and 
                listening to what other group members have to say, the team could arrive at a 
                breakthrough that moves your team forward in new and exciting ways.
